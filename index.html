      I've been working at <a href="https://www.thestar.com/" target="_blank">Toronto Star</a> over a year. Collabrating with an excenllent digital team, we have went through the transformation from a traditional local newspaper to a digital national brand. With the opportunity, I have been participated many projects through the organization. For example, our team have built the subscription user flow, including the paywall and the MPP payment system. I've introduced the unit test by using jest to the star mobile app. I've also worked on various UI/UX component changes for the website thestar.com, including the menu,newsletter box, breaking news banner etc. Currently as the anchor of the team, we are working on the redesign of the article pages, aiming to improve user's reading experience therefore increasing the number of subscriptions. We followed the practice of agile development through planning, story pointing and execution. I also helped with the technical interview process of hiring senior developers and automated QA positions.
